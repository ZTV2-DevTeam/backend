# FTV Email Notification Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ Announcement Email Notifications

**Features:**
- Automatic email notifications when announcements are created
- Email notifications when announcements are updated
- Support for both targeted (specific recipients) and global (all users) announcements
- Professional HTML email templates with FTV branding
- BCC functionality to send one email for all recipients (prevents SMTP blocking)

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/api_modules/authentication.py` - Added `send_announcement_notification_email()` function
- `backend/api_modules/communications.py` - Integrated email notifications into create/update endpoints

### ✅ Assignment (Beosztás) Email Notifications

**Features:**
- Email notifications when users are added to assignments
- Email notifications when users are removed from assignments
- Separate email templates for additions vs removals
- Assignment details included in emails (forgatas info, dates, times)
- Notifications sent during assignment creation, updates, and finalization

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/api_modules/authentication.py` - Added `send_assignment_change_notification_email()` function
- `backend/api_modules/assignments.py` - Integrated email notifications into assignment management endpoints

## Key Implementation Details

### SMTP Protection Strategy
- **Single Email per Action**: Uses BCC to send one email with multiple recipients
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Email failures don't break API functionality
- **Detailed Logging**: All email activities logged for troubleshooting

### Email Templates
- **Professional HTML Design**: Responsive templates with FTV branding
- **Plain Text Fallback**: Ensures compatibility with all email clients
- **Rich Content**: Includes all relevant information (dates, times, locations, etc.)
- **Consistent Styling**: Color-coded headers for different notification types

### API Integration
- **Transparent Integration**: Email notifications happen automatically
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing API functionality remains unchanged
- **Test Endpoints**: Added test endpoints for verifying email functionality

## Testing & Verification

### Test Files Created:
- `test_email_notifications.py` - Comprehensive test script
- `EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS.md` - Detailed documentation

### Test Endpoints Added:
- `POST /api/communications/test-email` - Test announcement emails
- `POST /api/assignments/test-email` - Test assignment emails

## Usage Examples

### Creating Announcement with Email Notification
```python
# API Call
POST /api/communications/announcements
{
  "title": "Important Notice",
  "body": "This is important information...",
  "recipient_ids": [1, 2, 3]  # Specific users
}

# Result: Email sent to users 1, 2, 3 via BCC
```

### Creating Global Announcement
```python
# API Call
POST /api/communications/announcements
{
  "title": "School-wide Notice",
  "body": "Information for everyone...",
  "recipient_ids": []  # Empty = all users
}

# Result: Email sent to ALL active users via BCC
```

### Updating Assignment with Email Notifications
```python
# API Call
PUT /api/assignments/filming-assignments/123
{
  "student_role_pairs": [
    {"user_id": 5, "szerepkor_id": 1},  # New user added
    {"user_id": 6, "szerepkor_id": 2}   # Another new user added
    # Previous users (1, 2, 3) removed
  ]
}

# Result: 
# - Addition email sent to users 5, 6
# - Removal email sent to users 1, 2, 3
```

## Technical Architecture

### Email Function Structure
```
authentication.py
├── send_announcement_notification_email()
│   ├── Creates HTML template for announcements
│   ├── Uses BCC for bulk sending
│   └── Returns success/failure status
│
└── send_assignment_change_notification_email()
    ├── Creates HTML templates for additions/removals
    ├── Sends separate emails for added vs removed users
    └── Includes complete forgatas information
```

### Integration Points
```
communications.py
├── create_announcement() → auto sends emails
├── update_announcement() → sends emails for changes
└── test_email() → test endpoint

assignments.py
├── create_filming_assignment() → emails assigned users
├── update_filming_assignment() → emails changed users
├── finalize_filming_assignment() → emails all users
└── test_email() → test endpoint
```

## Configuration Requirements

The system requires proper email configuration in `local_settings.py`:

```python
EMAIL_BACKEND = "django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend"
EMAIL_HOST = "smtp.gmail.com"
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = "your-email@gmail.com"
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = "your-app-password"
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = "FTV System <your-email@gmail.com>"
FRONTEND_URL = "https://ftv.szlg.info"
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **No SMTP Blocking**: BCC approach prevents rate limiting issues
2. **User Engagement**: Automatic notifications keep users informed
3. **Professional Communication**: Branded HTML templates look professional
4. **Reliable Delivery**: Graceful error handling ensures system stability
5. **Easy Testing**: Built-in test endpoints for verification
6. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs for troubleshooting

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Implementation**: Run the test script to verify functionality
2. **Configure Email Settings**: Set up proper SMTP credentials
3. **Deploy and Monitor**: Watch logs for any email delivery issues
4. **User Training**: Inform users about the new notification system

The implementation is complete and ready for testing and deployment!
